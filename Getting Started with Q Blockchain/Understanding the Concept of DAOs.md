# Understanding the Concept of DAOs

Hey folks, Welcome back! In last lesson, you learned about the Q Blockchain in detail. Now, you will learn what exactly a DAO is in detail. Lets dive into it right away!

## So, What exactly is a DAO?

Let’s understand DAOs using real-world example.

Imagine you and your friends want to make decisions together, like what game to play or what movie to watch. Normally, one person would be in charge and make the final decision. But what if you all want to have a say and make decisions together as a group? That's where a DAO comes in!

DAO stands for "Decentralized Autonomous Organization." It's like a special kind of group where decisions are made by everyone involved, without any one person being in charge. Instead of having a boss or a leader, a DAO uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to let everyone participate in the decision-making process.

In a DAO, blockchain helps keep track of all the decisions and actions taken by the group. It's a way of keeping everything transparent and fair.

A DAO is a group of people making decision together, using the blockchain to have a transparent and fair decision making process and an “unchangeable” record of the decisions’ outcomes.

## How do DAOs even work?

DAOs use something called smart contracts, which are like logical agreements written in code. These smart contracts used to make make decisions based on what happens on a special digital ledger called a blockchain.

For example, when a decision is made, the smart contract automatically does things like sending tokens, adding members, executing a function on blockchain to increase or decrease the number of tokens available.

When it's time to make decisions in a DAO, the voting process is recorded on the blockchain so everyone can see it and it cannot be changed. People who own more tokens in the DAO usually have more voting power. So, if you have more tokens, your vote counts more. But there is also DAOs, where one Member has only one vote. No matter how many tokens they have. 

![Frame 3560339 (14).png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xmetaschool/Learning-Projects/main/assests_for_all/assests_for_q/q-update/1.%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Q%20Blockchain/4.%20Understanding%20the%20Concept%20of%20DAOs/Frame_3560339_(14).webp)

The token based voting is often used , because of the idea, that you have more tokens, you're more invested in the DAO and more likely to make good decisions.

Imagine you have 25% of the overall voting power. If you do something bad for the DAO, it could make the value of your tokens go down, so you have an incentive to act in a good way.

DAOs often have treasuries, which are like a stash of tokens that can be used by the DAO. Members of the DAO can vote on how to use the tokens, like using it to buy digital items (for example NFTs) or even paying it to members of the DAO for their work.

## What are the pros and cons of DAOs?

Lets look at the following table to understand this better.

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Transparent - DAOs are designed to be transparent, which means that anyone can see the voting, funding decisions, and other actions that happen within the organization. This helps ensure fairness and accountability. | Speed - DAOs have a flat structure, which means they don't have a clear authority figure or chain of command like traditional organizations. This can make decision-making slower because everyone needs to agree on things before taking action. There is something called Expert Panels in DAOs on Q, that can help with this, but more to that later. |
| Participation - Unlike traditional companies, DAOs have a global reach, which means that people from all over the world can join and contribute. This makes it easier for anyone to participate, even if they don't have a lot of resources or connections. | Disagreements - Sometimes, disagreements within a DAO can be strong enough to split the organization into two separate groups. This can happen when different members have very different ideas about how things should be done. However, on Q, there is a way to manage this disagreements, without having to split the group. |
| Cheaper - DAOs are often cheaper to set up and operate compared to traditional companies. This is because there are many tools available in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space that can be used like building blocks, so you don't have to start from scratch. It's like using Lego pieces to build something instead of making everything from raw materials. | Security - There are legal considerations when it comes to token projects in DAOs. Some projects may be considered securities, which means they need to follow specific laws and regulations. Navigating these legal aspects can be challenging for DAOs. Q aims to provide some clarity by offering something called DAO Constitutions, but we will focus on the technology for now. |
| Collaborative - One of the great things about DAOs is that they encourage collaboration. By giving everyone a voice and allowing them to contribute their ideas and expertise, DAOs can pool together a lot of knowledge and skills. This helps in creating proposals and allows experts to invest in the ecosystem they are helping to build. | No change - In some DAOs, the people who have the most tokens have the most power and influence. This can make the governance of the DAO look similar to traditional organizations where a few individuals have a lot of control. |

## DAO example

A real example of a DAO is [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), which is like a special digital world, a metaverse. In Decentraland, you can create your own avatar, buy virtual land, and even start your own business.

Here's the interesting part: in Decentraland, there's no boss or person in charge. Instead, the people who own a special type of digital money called MANA can help make decisions and manage the whole platform together. It's like a big team where everyone has a say.

Even big companies like Coca-Cola and Adidas are part of this DAO and take part in the decision-making. They can use their influence to make decisions that benefit the whole community.

So, in summary, [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) is an example of a DAO where the members control everything, and even famous companies can join in and contribute.

## Why are we building DAO on Q blockchain?

Let's take a look at why building a DAO on Q Blockchain is a good choice:

- Transparency is one of the key benefits of using Q Blockchain for your DAO. It means that everything that happens within the organization can be seen by everyone involved, which brings fairness and openness to the decision-making process.
- Q Protocol helps define the governance structure of your DAO. For example, you can have different roles in your DAO (so called Expert Panels) who can make decisions on their own. This helps prevent potential issues or attacks on the DAO's governance, making it more secure and reliable.
- Building on Q allows your DAO to have clear rules, sometimes called a ‘DAO Constitution’. The DAO Constitution ****keeps everything transparent, so everyone knows what's happening and can trust the system.
- Building a DAO on Q Protocol aligns with the mission of creating a decentralized world. Because the Q blockchain itself is fully decentralized and even technical changes are made by the community of everyone on the blockchain. As infrastructure, the Q blockchain ****aims to make transactions transparent and enforceable, promoting fairness and trust among participants.
- The Q blockchain is designed to handle real-world assets and events. This means that you can integrate your DAO with actual things like property, goods, or other tangible items, making it more versatile and practical. For this things like the DAO Constitution and Expert Panels are very helpful. Put let’s focus on the technology for now ;)

## That’s a wrap

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts make DAOs popular and blockchain technology makes it possible.  

By choosing Q Blockchain for your DAO, you can enjoy the benefits of transparency, security, and efficiency, while contributing to the vision of a decentralized world.
