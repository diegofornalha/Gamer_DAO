# What Are We Building

gm everyone ‚òÄÔ∏è, today Metaschool and Q team are very excited to bring the first ever detailed course about Q blockchain for developers on Metaschool.

So what are we building? We will be building understanding of Q blockchain and how it works. We will build Gamer DAO with and without using Q GDK. We will add Airdrop functionality as well. This course is important as it equips you with necessary knowledge to ace your exciting journey of Q blockchain.

Here's how your DAO front-end will look like:

The Q Protocol is made up of proof-of-stake blockchain that's compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Which means, smart contracts that work on other chains like Ethereum also work on Q. It also includes a bunch of smart contracts that make everything run smoothly.

**Why Q?** Q has more than 50 dApps and 100+ partners and builders including Chainlayer, web3.org, Tencent Cloud and many more. It has cross chain connectivity with Ethereum and a bridge too!

## Course overview

We will:

1. Develop understanding of Q blockchain and how does it work
2. Develop understand of what is DAO and how do they work
3. Create and deploy a Gamer DAO using Solidity and Remix IDE
4. Create and deploy a Gamer DAO using Q GDK
5. Learn and understand Merkle tree, Merkle proof, and AirDrop
6. Add the AirDrop module as DAO resource
7. Add front-end to Gamer DAO

**Keep your momentum going! In 9th (Prerequisites to Building Gamer DAO) to 20th (Initialize the AirDropV2 Module) lesson, we‚Äôll teach the most exciting part of the course which I can‚Äôt wait to tell you about.**

## Who exactly should take this course?

This course is for enthusiastic web3 developers who wish to learn about Q blockchain. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain, [consensus mechanism](https://metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/), Solidity Programming language, and programming basics because in this course we will focus more on building Gamer DAO.

Don't worry! We will cover essential concepts along the way and explain code in detail that you won't feel lacking behind.

## Prerequisites

- Metamask extension installed in your browser ([Chrome extension link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn))
